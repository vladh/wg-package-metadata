## Binary Dependencies

### General
- [_The C-Shaped Hole in Package Management_][c-shaped] by Andrew Nesbitt, a great post about the problem of binary
  dependencies.
- [_Dependency Resolution in Python: Beware The Phantom Dependency_][phantom] by Anand Sawant is where the term _phantom
  dependency_ was originally coined.
- [Issue #1261][ecosystems-packages-1261] on the <a href="https://ecosyste.ms" class="suplink">ecosyste.ms</a> _packages_
  repo collects more information on strategies for tracking binary dependencies across multiple package managers.
- [_ESSTRA_][esstra] is a tool developed at Sony that aims to improve supply chain transparency by embedding metadata
  into binaries.
- [UAPI specification 8][uapi-8] provides a section within ELF binaries for recording the provenance of a dynamic
  library, including the name of the system package it originated from. See also Fedora's page about [_Package
  information on ELF objects_][fedora-package-info].
- [UAPI specification 12][uapi-12] provides a section within ELF binaries for recording the names of libraries loaded
  with `dlopen()`. This would hypothetically allow us to keep track of libraries opened with
  [_libffi_][libffi]/[_cffi_][cffi]. However, I'm not sure how these records would be filled in, since it's possible for
  the names of libraries opened with `dlopen()` to not be known until runtime.
- The [_PURL registry_][purl-registry] is a registry of packages, mainly C/C++ packages, that do not otherwise have a
  [PURL][purl] because they are not clearly identified in package registries. Such a registry could be used for
  assigning reliable identities to binary dependencies.

### Python
- [_auditwheel_][auditwheel], a widely-used Python package that can identify a wheel's required dynamic libraries, but
  does not yet have accurate human-readable output, or an API for researchers and developers to use.
- [_elfdeps_][elfdeps], a lesser-known Python package that can identify a wheel's required dynamic libraries and _does
  have_ a public API.
- [PEP 770][seth-pep-770], in which author Seth Larson introduces SBOMs to Python packages. See also his
  [PR #577][auditwheel-577] to [_auditwheel_][auditwheel], which enables users to discover binary dependencies,
  and include them in a package's SBOM.
- [PEP 725][pep-725], which specifies a way to record binary dependencies in `pyproject.toml`. This interoperable record
  of binary dependencies could allow many tools to, for example, flag security issues that were previously invisible.
- [PEP 804][pep-804], which specifies a system for mapping binary dependency names to packages in non-Python registries.
- [_Fromager_][fromager] is a tool that aims, among other things, to provide a way for Python packages to be built
  completely from source, which includes building all their binary dependencies from source. I am not sure whether this
  is actually implemented yet.
- In a paper titled [_Insight: Exploring Cross-Ecosystem Vulnerability Impacts_][insight], Xu et al describe a system
  for identifying when Python code calls into parts of C-based dynamic libraries that are known to have security
  vulnerabilities. According to their research, 24.0% of PyPI projects “transitively invoke vulnerable APIs from C
  libraries”. Note, however, that Xu et al analyse Python code that calls into binary dependencies _using `dlopen()`_,
  which is a notable caveat, since these kinds of FFI calls are not the most common way to call into binary
  dependencies. See my [post on how binary dependencies work][how-bindeps-work] for more information.

## Node.js
- [_How to publish binaries on npm_][npm-bin-pub] by Luca Forstner tells us that it's possible, but tricky, to publish
  binary packages on _npm_.
